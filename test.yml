      # Timestamp spec: If repeat-weekly is present, then the timestamp will be
      # created for the last day matching the given weekday. The time is used
      # to set the time of day when the snapshot "rolls over".

      # Weekdays are denoted in english 3-letter abbreviations. Time is denoted
      # in 24 hour HH:MM format.

      # Example:
      #   - repeat-weekly set to monday, time set to 00:00:
      #      - executed on monday 01:00: a new snapshot is created labelled
      #        with the timestamp of monday (ex. 20151102T0000Z).
      #      - executed on tuesday, 02:00: nothing happens, as there is already
      #        a snapshot matching the "last" repeat date
