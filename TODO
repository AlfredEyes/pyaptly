# All code moves somewhere else

- Tests to the tests/ directory
- Everything else away from legacy.py
- Remove version.py completely

# Update old files

The following files have just been copied without checking if their content is ok:

- CHANELOG
- CHANELOG.rst
- README.rst

The reason for this is to ensure the continuity of the git history.

# Tool to convert yaml config to toml

- This is probably just a sub-command of pyaptly
- We probably still want to switch to a modern yaml parser

# Replace all subprocess commands with a modern one (run_command())

# All logging should be done via logging (no stdout/stderr)

# Remove all top-level `# type: ignore` and all `# type: ignore  # TODO`

# Add good documentation to every function and module, but plan to review all of
  it once everything is in place

# Do all output via logging module

- Idea show INFO and above, but display info without timestamp etc.

# latest, maybe repeat:

- replace all prints with logging
- correctly do getLogger
- is this unit_or_list... thing still needed
- remove codecs.open
- use pathlib.Path
- replace state_reader.state with function
- remove six
- remote test.py completely

- Build package

  sudo dnf install python3-click python3-frozendict python3-pyyaml python3-tomli python3-tomli-w python3-devel python3-setuptools

- remove pyp2rpm and just put a spec into build-rpm, like in venv-rpm

- venv-rpm hardcodes version 2.0.0 in some places

- review rpm build and improve it later

- This is string is wrong in several places:

  Automates the creation and managment of aptly mirrors and snapshots based on yml input files
