# All code moves somewhere else

- Tests to the tests/ directory
- Everything else away from legacy.py
- Remove version.py completely

# Update old files

The following files have just been copied without checking if their content is ok:

- CHANELOG
- CHANELOG.rst
- README.rst

The reason for this is to ensure the continuity of the git history.

# Tool to convert yaml config to toml

- This is probably just a sub-command of pyaptly
- We probably still want to switch to a modern yaml parser

# Replace all subprocess commands with a modern one (run_command())

# All logging should be done via logging (no stdout/stderr)

# Remove all top-level `# type: ignore` and all `# type: ignore  # TODO`

# Add good documentation to every function and module, but plan to review all of
  it once everything is in place

# Do all output via logging module

- Idea show INFO and above, but display info without timestamp etc.
